### Running with Postgres:

To run the Petclinic application with Postgres, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=postgres`
- `POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<POSTGRES_HOST>/petclinic`
- `POSTGRES_USER=<POSTGRES_USERNAME>`
- `POSTGRES_PASS=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>`

Please replace `<POSTGRES_HOST>`, `<POSTGRES_USERNAME>`, and `<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>` with the actual host, username, and password of your Postgres database.

Remember to secure your `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASS` as they are sensitive information related to your database.

With these settings, the Petclinic application will be able to persist data using the Postgres database.
